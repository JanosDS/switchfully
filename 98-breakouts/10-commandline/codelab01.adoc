= Command line
== Presentation commandline

=== What?
A way to communicate to your system without using the UI.

=== Why does it exist?
It's the original system.

Before you had an OS like windows you could only interact with the system using commandline.

That's why you can do almost everything in commandline.

=== Why use it?

* It is fast to type a command.
* It executes fast.
* You know most of the time exactly what something does.
* Easy to script or to configure.
* Complete control!

=== Different types?
Because it used to be the core business of an OS, every OS has it own commands and way of working.

You'll be mostly working with Linux-based commands and Windows based command.

With Git-bash you can use a lot of linux commands in Windows (but not all!).

Command Prompt was never designed properly so most of the commands don't work as well.

We prefer using Git-bash or Windows Powershell.

=== What can you do with it?
With bash you can do almost everything:

* installing programs
* downloading links
* creating and modifying files
* you name it.

Let's get you through the basics!
