     * Make a program that will ask the user: "Which kind of greeting do you want (hello/goodbye)?: "
     * Depending on the answer you print out a different message:
     * - in case of 'hello': "We welcome you to our awesome application!"
     * - in case of 'goodbye': "Goodbye, hope to see you again."
     *
     * You can make your life easier by just copying the code from the previous exercise and use that as a starting point.
     * Finished? Try it out!
     *
     * Before we continue, did you think of the edge cases?
     * Try to think of all the different ways a user can break your small application.
     * Which ones can you prevent?
     * Adapt your solution with guard clauses so that even if the user writes something unexpected, your program still behaves in a logical way.
