# Set up your own PostgreSQL database

**Database Starter**

The next codelabs will require you to change data in the HR schema. In order to do this, we need to set up our own database so we can each have
a separate version of the schema. 

**Local setup**
- [ ] When connected to a PostgreSQL server, open up a console and create your own database (CREATE DATABASE yourfirstandlastname;)
- [ ] Once you did this, execute hr-schema.sql and hr-data.sql. Make sure you are executing this onto your own database (top right screen tells you which database and schema you are working on)
- [ ] If all went well, you should now see your own database and the hr schema inside of it.
