# Rowdy Racers

![Rowdy Racers](rowdy_racers.png)

You're about to create a turn-based game called **Rowdy Racers**.

Please read this entire `README.md` file (diagonally) before getting started.

## Technical tips for JAVA
- Use Java Swing or JavaFX to create the GUI
    - JavaFX, it's the big/better brother, successor of Java Swing.
- Seperate the domain from the GUI: the domain should not contain any GUI code. The GUI should not contain any of the Rowdy Racer rules (the GUI just needs to draw visual things to the screen)
    - (Optionally: You can look into the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to help you with this)
        - (The following code example should make it a bit more clear: [MVC explained](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/mvc_pattern.htm))
        - (Or, check the Head-First Design Pattern book that is (hopefully) located near you.)
    
## Technical tips for .NET
- Use WPF (Windows specific)
- Seperate the domain from the GUI: the domain should not contain any GUI code. The GUI should not contain any of the Rowdy Racer rules (the GUI just needs to draw visual things to the screen)
    - Create multiple projects in one solution to properly achieve this
    - Look into MVVM

## Description of Rowdy Racers

**Disclaimer**: This is a difficult exercise, it will definitely take you more than a day to make it 'work'! 
It will take you more than a week to make it work properly (with a flexible design, maintainable,...).

There are multiple iterations of Rowdy Racers, meaning that in a new iteration additional features might be requested, 
or existing behavior / features needs to be modified.

Start with the first iteration, the first iteration is written down below, in the remainder of this file.

Only when you're finished with this iteration, take a look at the next iteration. 
It's in `/Iterations/NextIterations01/Readme.md`

Good luck, have fun.

### Rowdy Racers
Rowdy Racers is game that is played on a grid. Each of two players try to
reach their target before the other player does.

#### GUI

You'll have to create a (visual) GUI that resembles the following mockup:

![Rowdy Racers GUI](rowdy_racers_gui.jpg)

### 1. Actions
The game is turn-based. During each turn, a player is allowed to perform 3 individual actions.
The kind of each action can be chosen by the player. The following kinds of actions are supported:

1. The first kind of action is to move.
2. The second kind of action is to pick up an item.
3. The third kind of action is to use an item
4. The fourth kind of action is to end the turn. In this case, an empty action is performed for
each remaining action in the turn.

#### Move action - Extra information
- During a single action, a player can move one square in any direction (vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal).
- No two players can occupy the same square at the same time.
- A player cannot occupy a square that is occupied by a wall.
- A player cannot leave the grid.
- When a player moves, he leaves a light trail behind on his previous square. The light
trail remains active during 2 additional actions. After that, the light trail disappears.
Therefore, the maximum length of the light trail is 3 squares.
- A player cannot cross any light trail: he cannot enter a square that contains a light
trail, and he cannot pass through a diagonal light trail.
- A player is not allowed to end the turn on the square that he started the turn on.
- If a player cannot move during his turn, he is trapped and loses the game.
- If a player reaches the starting position of his opponent, he wins the game.

#### Pick up action - Extra information
- A player can only pick up an item that is placed on the same square as the player.
- A player can carry at most six items.

#### Use item action - Extra information
- A player can only use an item that is in his inventory.

### 2. The Grid
The grid on which the game is played has a rectangular shape for which the size can be configured
when the game is started. The minimum grid size is 10x10. Player 1 starts on the bottom
left corner of the grid, player 2 starts on the top right corner. The finish for each player is the
starting location of the other player.

### 3. Walls
At the start of the game, walls are placed on the grid. A wall forms a barrier that a player cannot
cross.

1. Walls are placed either horizontal or vertical, and have a width of 1 square.
2. The direction of each wall is chosen randomly.
3. The minimal length of a wall is two squares.
4. The maximum length (in terms of the numbers of squares that it covers) of a vertical
(horizontal) wall is 50% of the vertical (horizontal) size of the grid, rounded up to an
integer value.
5. The number of walls is chosen randomly.
6. There is at least 1 wall.
7. At most 20% of the squares in the grid, rounded up to an integer value, is covered by a
wall.
8. A wall cannot cover the starting position of a player.

### 4. Items
Light grenades are items that can be picked up and used by a player.

1. When a player uses a light grenade, the light grenade is removed from his inventory and
placed on the current square of the player. Initially, the light grenade is inactive. The light
grenade becomes active when the player leaves the square.
2. An active light grenade is invisible and cannot be picked up.
3. A player cannot use multiple light grenades on the same square.
4. When any player enters a square with an active light grenade, it explodes. The player that
moved on the light grenade is blinded and loses his next 3 actions
5. An exploded light grenade is not active.
6. Active and exploded light grenades cannot be picked up.

## Separate the Domain from the GUI

Your project should be divided into 2 distinct parts:

1. The **domain**
    - Which resides in a specific package, e.g.: the `com.switchfully.project.rowdyracers.domain` package.
2. The **GUI**
    - Which resides in a specific package, e.g.: the `com.switchfully.project.rowdyracers.gui` package.
    
### Domain

The domain is the representation (model) of the actual business domain of Rowdy Racers:

- The domain (model) contains all the domain objects such as `Game`, `Grid`, `Square`, `Player`,...
- The domain should contain all the business rules and functional requirements of Rowdy Racers. This means that all 
the rules that make Rowdy Racers the game it is should be implemented in the domain, NOT in the GUI.
- Never, ever, should any GUI code (e.g. any class from `java.awt` or `javax.swing` or `javafx`) be used in the domain. 
Our domain should be pure and completely independent from any GUI library / framework used!
    - Our domain is (G)UI framework agnostic, we can rather quickly use our domain in a different GUI than the current. 

It is important you remember - and adhere to - these rules.
- Otherwise, before you known it, your domain is tightly coupled with your GUI. Making it very difficult to keep a clear 
overview of what is happening where, updates to the GUI might impact the domain, replacing the GUI with 
another technology becomes difficult and a lot of work,...  

### GUI

The GUI should be as **dumb as possible**, meaning it should not implement any of the rules of Rowdy Racers. It should
always delegate that responsibility to the domain objects.

Because of this architecture / design and its clear separation of concerns, you should rather easily be able to use a 
different GUI with the same domain.
