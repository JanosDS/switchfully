# Exercise 02

Agile Software Development is not rocket science.
Using common sense can you find a way that the following case could have been avoided?
Discuss in groups of 4 to 5 people.
For each of the cases:
- What would you try to do to avoid the same problem in the future?
    - If you're stuck use the Agile Principles for inspiration. 

## Cases
- Bert is an analyst on a software project and needs to test some new features on an old application. 
There is tight deadline because the new features should go into production by the end of the week. 
To be able to test these new features he needs receive access to the old application. 
However, by the end of the week he still doesn't have an answer from the helpdesk.

- Louise and her team are working on a new search function for their application. 
After some research, a more modern database seems to be the ideal solution. 
To test their suspicions, they ask management to set up a server to install this new database technology on. 
Management decides to set up a working group to compare the costs and benefits of various similar database technologies. 
Months later, they still haven't made a decision and Louise still hasn't tested the new database technology.

- Milan is working on a big data project and needs a stronger laptop to process the heavy calculations. 
He sends an email to acquisitions asking if he can get the better hardware. 
For them that is ok, but they say they need permission from their manager. 
Milan sends an email to their manager, who also gives his approval, but first wants him to check if the standard corporate software can be installed on it. 
Milan then sends an email to the software installation team. 
These ask for more specifications of the new laptop and that he sends an email to their manager, so they can make time for the installation in their calendar. 
Etc... .
20+ mails and several weeks later Milan is a lot of frustration but still no stronger laptop in sight.

- Sofie is a developer for a consultancy software company. 
During the development of a new feature she realizes that the current software unnecessarily makes the software too complex for the user costing him a lot of time. 
She thinks that with a week's work she can simplify the software significantly. 
When she proposes these improvements to the team, they answer that this feature is not specified in the contract with the client.
They argue that if it's really important the client will ask for it. In the end, they never propose the feature to the customer.

- Philippe is a developer for a hospital application. 
His team manages to deliver all requested features correctly and on time by the end of the year. As a reward they receive a big compliment from the customer. 
Philips starts his Christmas holidays in good spirits. 
During a Christmas party, he gets to talk to a doctor who uses his application on a daily basis. 
She tells him that she and her colleagues get neither head nor tail of the application and that it is almost impossible to use. 
Philippe is disillusioned by this news.

- Kaat is an analyst and sits at a customer meeting. 
The customer asks if it is possible to use artificial intelligence to gain more insight into the behaviour of their users. 
Her boss blocks the request and says they don't have an Artificial Intelligence department. 
When she addresses her boss after the meeting about the fact that one of her developers is passionately involved with AI in his spare time, he answers that they already have a shortage of developers and that they can't spare anyone on side projects.

- Jack is a bank clerk. 
He and his colleagues have been annoyed for years with the outdated software they have to work with. 
After many requests, a budget is freed up to write new software. 
Initially they ask him for advice on what the new software should look like. 
A year later, when he asks how the project is doing, he hears that the project has gone over budget and has been stopped. 
No letter code has been written.

- Marie is a manager and receives an urgent phone call from her customer that the latest release has broken an important function. 
She immediately runs to the software team hoping to find a quick solution. 
There, however, she's told that the feature was created by Karen and that she's on vacation. 
Marie will have to wait at least a week before she even can have someone look at the problem, since the rest of the team doesn't know what Karen was working on.

- Patrick is a manager of a software company. 
After his team is way too late delivering a new release for the customer, he arranges a meeting with the whole team to find out what is going on. 
The meeting ends in an argument between the developers and the testers where the developers claim that the testers are far too slow and that the testers claim that the developers only deliver software faulty.

- Amber has just been hired as a software developer to help renew the application landscape. 
The first months she works there is hardly any work because the analyses are still in full swing and go over time.
After a long wait, her team receives an analysis document of several hundred pages that they have to implement. 
In good spirits, they start with the implementation. 
After a few weeks, however, it becomes clear that a big part of the requested features are just not technically feasible.
