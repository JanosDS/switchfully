# Fruit Exercise

- Form groups of 4 to 5 people
- Fill in the rest of the table
- For each story:
    1. Have small discussion on how big the effort is going to be
    1. As soon as everybody got a number in his/her head: estimate!
    1. If there is any difference between the numbers let the highest and lowest estimates explain their reasoning
    1. Find a consensus (if necessary estimate again)
    1. Fill in the number in the table
